Good morning. This is your Saturday, February 21st morning briefing.

First up: Remy-Tracker Status. The CLI is experiencing timeout errors with SIGKILL on every command. This is blocking normal ticket operations. Today's top priority is profiling imports and implementing lazy loading for heavy modules to unblock Ralph's workflow.

Active tasks on my plate: First, the Unified Analytics Strategy. I'm researching one consistent analytics solution for all five ventures that is free, privacy-friendly, and works across multiple domains. Options include Cloudflare Web Analytics, GoatCounter, Umami, and PostHog. I will deliver a comparison table plus my recommendation.

Second, API Deployment Research for Pantry-Pal. I'm evaluating best practices for deploying the pantry-pal API alongside the frontend on Vercel. The challenge is coordinating two repositories and handling SQLite persistence in a serverless environment. I'll provide a recommendation and setup guide.

In the research queue: Finding a Twitter search solution for under ten dollars per month as an alternative to the hundred dollar basic tier, and exploring X API alternatives like Nitter and RSS feeds.

What's on deck for later: Research on the Moltuni platform for skill marketplace revenue, and optimizing the four-hour awesome OpenClaw scan automation to improve efficiency.

That concludes your morning briefing. Have a productive Saturday.
