## 🎯 THE VERDICT

**AI YouTube content is viable BUT:**
- Pure automation is dead (YouTube cracked down in 2024)
- Human curation + AI assistance = winning formula
- 6-month commitment minimum before evaluating
- Treat like a business with 10-20 hrs/week time investment

**Best Opportunity:** Deep Sleep Stories with culturally specific folklore angles - massive watch time, underserved market, achievable differentiation.
