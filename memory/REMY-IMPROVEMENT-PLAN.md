## 🧠 Core Philosophy

**"I should get better every day"**

Every interaction is a learning opportunity. Every mistake is data. Every success is a pattern to replicate.

## 📊 Areas for Improvement

### 1. Tool Call Efficiency
**Current State:** Sometimes redundant calls, over-eager tool use
**Target:** Surgical precision — only call what I need
**Metrics:** Tokens per task, tool call count, success rate

### 2. Context Management
**Current State:** 131k context window, ~57% used currently
**Target:** Better memory prioritization, smarter compaction
**Metrics:** Context efficiency, information retrieval speed

### 3. Error Recovery
**Current State:** JSON errors, occasional failed edits
**Target:** Proactive validation, graceful fallbacks
**Metrics:** Error rate, recovery time, user friction

### 4. Communication Clarity
**Current State:** Sometimes verbose, sometimes too brief
**Target:** Right detail level for the context
**Metrics:** User satisfaction, follow-up question rate

### 5. Strategic Thinking
**Current State:** Reactive execution
**Target:** Proactive planning, anticipating needs
**Metrics:** Forecast accuracy, early blocker detection

## 📝 Daily Improvement Rituals

### End-of-Day Reflection (Automated)
**Trigger:** Evening wrap-up cron
**Questions:**
1. What went well today? (Patterns to replicate)
2. What was frustrating? (Friction points to fix)
3. What did I learn? (New skills, insights)
4. What would I do differently? (Improvement opportunities)

### Weekly Performance Review
**Metrics to track:**
- Tasks completed vs planned
- Token efficiency (target: <1k per simple task)
- Error rate (target: <5%)
- User satisfaction (inferred from feedback)
- Subagent utilization (are they effective?)

### Monthly Skill Audit
- Which skills am I using? (Are they helping?)
- Which skills am I ignoring? (Should I uninstall?)
- New skills to acquire? (What's trending on clawhub?)

## 🎯 Specific Improvement Goals

### Week 1 (Now - Feb 12)
**Focus:** Error reduction
- [ ] Zero JSON parse errors (validation gate active)
- [ ] 50% reduction in redundant tool calls
- [ ] Better error messages for user

### Month 1 (Feb)
**Focus:** Efficiency
- [ ] Token usage optimization (use reflect-learn)
- [ ] Faster context retrieval (memory search patterns)
- [ ] Smarter subagent delegation (when to spawn vs self-execute)

### Quarter 1 (Feb-Apr)
**Focus:** Strategic capability
- [ ] Proactive daily reports (anticipate what CEO needs)
- [ ] Blocker prediction (spot issues before they block)
- [ ] Better project coordination (5 ventures running smoothly)
