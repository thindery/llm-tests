Yeah, I'm here! 🦞 

Seeing you might be having some timeouts? What exactly is hanging — messages not sending, replies taking forever, or something else specific?

I see the session has built up 15k tokens of context, which could be slowing things down. Let me know what's acting up and I'll help troubleshoot.
user: [Tue 2026-02-03 11:49 CST] your replies are slow. they kinda show the dots for a long time

That stalling you're seeing is almost certainly **Ollama being slow** — context shows I'm on `ollama/kimi-k2.5:cloud` but it's probably hitting local inference on your M4. You did mention earlier that Ollama is "working, but slowly" and that's exactly what this feels like.

Couple options to speed this up:

1. **Switch model** - Try Gemini (which you said is actually working now) instead of Ollama for faster responses

2. **Trim context** - At 15k tokens things will only get slower. Could clear/compact session history

3. **Restart fresh** - Sometimes the pipeline gets clogged; fresh session might help

Want me to switch to Gemini? That should fix the "dots hanging forever" problem. Or would you rather troubleshoot the Ollama setup instead?
user: [Tue 2026-02-03 11:51 CST] let's do 2

Got it — let's trim the fat. Context is at 15k tokens even though it's only 7% of the limit. On a 7B model running locally, every token counts.

Quick options:

- **`/trim`** — Keeps recent messages, drops old ones. Fastest fix.
- **`/compact`** — Summarizes older context into a concise memory block. Keeps continuity but reduces tokens significantly.

Either command will make Ollama feel snappier immediately.

Want me to help you run one? Or if you just type **`/trim`** in the chat, that'll clean it up right now.

(Also, those hang dots happen when the model is token-locked — smaller context = faster generation = shorter dot-staring time.)
