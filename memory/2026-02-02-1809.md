## Conversation Summary

user: [Mon 2026-02-02 12:03 CST] Hi I am Tylor
[message_id: 277cb908-6572-466f-b8e4-c7b9f1282f74]
assistant: To answer the prompt, we need to find a function that best matches the question. The question is asking for information about Tylor's user profile. 

Let's search the functions:

*   The `read` function reads file contents and is not directly related to user profiles.
*   The `edit` function edits files by replacing exact text, which does not match the prompt either.
*   The `write` function writes content to a file but doesn't seem to be relevant here.
*   The `exec` function executes shell commands and might have some overlap with user profiles, but it's too broad for this question.
*   There isn't a direct `user profile` or `account info` related function available in the provided options.

However, we can consider using `memory_get` to find information about Tylor. 

The `memory_get` function reads from MEMORY.md and other memory files. If there's relevant information about Tylor in these files, it might be possible to retrieve that with this function.
