## Conversation Summary

user: [Tue 2026-02-03 11:33 CST] i think we had some issues there for a min

assistant:  <final>Yeah, looks like we hit some turbulence there! I think you saw the dashboard freeze up or get into a weird state for a bit. From what I can see, things have stabilized now and we're back in sync. Let me know if you're still seeing any weirdness on your end! 🦞</final>
user: [Tue 2026-02-03 11:34 CST] i want to review our TEAM and what llms they are using. i have access to ollama and all the different cloud models. i think everyone is running kimi2. but maybe devs should be using something different? and architects somethng different? Any thoughts - i want to give the team the best skills and llms to be sucecssful

assistant:  Great call reviewing this! Right now it looks like the team is all defaulting to Kimi K2.5. Here are my thoughts on optimizing by role:

## 🎯 Recommended Model Assignments

| Role | Recommended | Why |
|------|-------------|-----|
| **Tech Lead 👨‍💼** | Kimi K2.5 (strong) or escalate to Claude 3.5 Sonnet/o1-mini for critical reviews | Needs top-tier reasoning for catching subtle bugs, security issues, and architecture flaws. This is your quality gate—worth the spend when needed. |
| **Dev 🛠️** | Kimi K2.5 (free tier) | Code-heavy, implementation-focused work. K2.5 punches above its weight on coding tasks. Perfect for feature churn. |
| **API Architect 🔌** | Kimi K2.5 or o1-mini for complex designs | Backend design benefits from logical reasoning. K2.5 for standard APIs, escalate to reasoning models for tricky auth/edge cases. |
| **Frontend Architect ⚛️** | Kimi K2.5 or Gemini Flash | Pattern-heavy work (components, TypeScript types). Fast and cheap since it's mostly applying known patterns. |
| **UI/UX Designer 🎨** | GPT-4o or Claude | Needs aesthetic/creative judgment on visual layouts. Coding models aren't great at "does this look good?" — consider a more generalist model here. |
| **QA 🧪** | Kimi K2.5 or smaller/faster model | Systematic test case generation doesn't need heavy reasoning. Speed > depth here. |

## 💡 My Suggestion

Given your setup (Ollama working but slow), here's a pragmatic split:

1. **Start local when possible:** Ollama (qwen2.5:7b) for Dev and QA tasks on small/straightforward features
2. **Escalate for critical work:** Tech Lead gets Claude/o1-mini for reviews that matter
3. **Keep K2.5 as the workhorse:** Dev, API Arch, FE Arch all use K2.5 for daily tasks
4. **Try Gemini Flash for Designer:** Since you have it working, test if it's decent at CSS/UX reasoning

Want me to update TEAM.md with these recommendations? Or do you want to test different configurations first?
user: [Tue 2026-02-03 11:40 CST] noo i don't want to use local models. they are too slow. let's use the ollama gemini version: gemini-3-flash-preview:cloud and it sounds like everyone else will stay on k2.5 for now

user: [Tue 2026-02-03 11:42 CST] noo i don't want to use local models. they are too slow. For design - let's use the ollama gemini version: gemini-3-flash-preview:cloud and it sounds like everyone else will stay on k2.5 for now

user: [Tue 2026-02-03 11:46 CST] okay let's just keep them all on k2.5 for now. no updates at this time.
