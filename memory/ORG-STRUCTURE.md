## Communication Architecture

### Discord Channels (Proposed)

| Channel | Purpose | Audience |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **#executive** | Strategic decisions, CEO↔COO only | Thindery + Remy |
| **#daily** | Consolidated daily reports from all ventures | Everyone |
| **#pantry-pal-team** | Product updates, blockers, launches | Pantry-Pal team |

| **#sleep-stories-team** | Content pipeline, video production | Content team |
| **#agentads-team** | Moonshot sprint, investor updates | AgentAds team |
| **#general** | Cross-team chatter, celebrations | Everyone |

### Reporting Cadence

**Daily (7am CST):**
- I post consolidated update to #daily
- Each venture's status: shipped, in progress, blocked
- Metrics: revenue, users, progress to goals

**Weekly (Monday):**
- VP-level sync (if needed)
- Resource allocation decisions
- Strategic pivots

**As Needed:**
- #executive channel for your strategic input
- Escalations when VPs need CEO decision

## Elon Musk Model Principles

1. **Multiple Ventures, One Vision** — All contribute to Mac Studio Fund & personal growth
2. **Dedicated Teams** — Each venture has its own VP and resources
3. **Centralized Ops** — Remy coordinates, you focus on strategy
4. **Ruthless Prioritization** — Pantry-Pal launches first (revenue now), others follow
5. **Transparent Reporting** — You know status of all 4 without micromanaging
