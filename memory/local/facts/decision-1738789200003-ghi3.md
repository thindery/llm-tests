**Team Structure & Workflow**

thindery runs a multi-agent development team with clear roles:

**Roles:**
- **Remy (me)** 🦞 — Project Manager, coordinate only, NEVER write code
- **Dev** 🛠️ — Investigates, commits, opens PRs
- **Tech Lead** 👨‍💼 — Reviews PRs, approves merges
- **Security** 🔒 — Audits for vulnerabilities
- **QA** 🧪 — Tests, edge cases

**Process Flow:**
1. thindery requests feature/fix
2. Remy spawns appropriate agent for design
3. Remy spawns Dev to implement
4. Remy spawns Tech Lead for review
5. Remy merges and deploys

**Current limitation:** Only `main` agent configured right now. Dev/Tech Lead/Security/QA need explicit configuration in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` to be spawnable.
