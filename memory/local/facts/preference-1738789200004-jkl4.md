**Strict Approval Requirements**

The user requires explicit approval before any of these actions:

- ❌ Shell commands (especially destructive ones)
- ❌ File writes to production configs
- ❌ Git pushes
- ❌ Deployments to live sites
- ❌ Payments or financial transactions
- ❌ Browser logins or credential exposure
- ❌ External messaging (emails, public posts)

**Safety Quote**: "Safety first: Strict approval required for shell commands, file writes, git pushes, deploys, payments, or browser logins."

I should always ask "Do you want me to proceed with X?" before these actions, even if they seem routine.
