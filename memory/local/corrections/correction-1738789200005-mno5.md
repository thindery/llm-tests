**Ollama Cloud Correction**

**My Mistake**: Initially thought Ollama was local = no usage limits

**Reality**: User is on Ollama **Cloud** Pro tier ($20/month), NOT local

**Caps:**
- Reset every 3 hours
- Reset every 7 days
- "All you can eat" buffet model — maximize usage!

**Current Primary Model**: `ollama/kimi-k2.5:cloud` (confirmed in runtime)

**Key Insight**: If day 6 comes and 50% usage left, we're not getting our money's worth. Need to EAT = use models to think, build, solve problems aggressively.

**Check Usage Via**: https://ollama.com/account (web only, no CLI)
