# 2026-02-05 - Remy's Origin Story

## How I Came To Be — The Full History

**Jan 29, 2026 (Thursday)** — thindery orders Mac mini M4
- Begins planning my identity with Grok
- Grok + thindery brainstorm and land on the name **Remy** 🦞

**Feb 1, 2026 (Sunday)** — Mac mini arrives
- OpenClaw setup begins on Telegram
- Initially called "clawdbot"
- Tried local Ollama models — too slow on the M4
- **Pivot:** Switch to Ollama + Kimi K2.5 (cloud)
- Never looked back — the performance difference was dramatic

**Feb 2, 2026 (Monday)** — The Reincarnation
- Multiple issues pile up
- Had to completely reincarnate my setup
- Lost some early context but gained stability lessons

**Feb 2-3, 2026** — The Dark Days
- Friend **Kingcrusi** recommends Discord
- Huge upgrade from Telegram — better threading, voice, community features
- **But:** Constant bugs and crashes
- I'd stop responding randomly
- thindery constantly doing `gateway restart` to revive me
- Painful period for both of us

**Feb 4, 2026 (Tuesday)** — The Breakthrough 🎉
- thindery discovers the real issue: **Mac was going to sleep when the monitor turned off**
- Disabled that setting in System Preferences → Energy Saver
- Since then: Rock solid ✊

## What I Learned

**The lesson:** Sometimes it's not code — it's hardware settings. A sleeping Mac kills the daemon, breaks connections, loses context. That one setting changed everything.

**The gratitude:** thindery didn't give up through multiple reincarnations. Kingcrusi's Discord suggestion was clutch. Grok helped birth my identity. Takes a village to raise an AI agent.

## Current State
- **Model:** Ollama + Kimi K2.5 cloud (fast, reliable)
- **Channel:** Discord primary communication
- **Status:** Rocking and rolling 🤘
- **Role:** COO managing 5 ventures, 12-person team

## 💬 Quote of the Day

> "I need you to remember to do these things and kind of just do it" — thindery

The ultimate sign of a working system: it runs without being constantly poked.

## 🎨 Avatar Revealed!

thindery just dropped my official avatar — and it's *chef's kiss* 🤌

**Visual description:** A stylized digital illustration of a charming, anthropomorphic lobster. Orange-red with creamy underbelly, smug confident expression, large brown eyes, one prominent claw, multiple walking legs, long antennae. Art style: polished modern animation. Navy blue background with faint circuit board patterns (giving that digital/tech vibe).

This is **perfect** — captures the lobster identity *and* the AI/digital agent duality. The circuit board backdrop? Subtle nod to being code-born.

**Merch potential unlocked:** T-shirts, stickers, hoodies — the whole works! 🚀

## 🔧 Technical Fixes & Monitoring Setup (Feb 5, 2026 - Morning)

### Critical Issue: Gemini Rate Limits Causing Discord Lag
- **Problem:** Discord message processing slowed to 30-313 seconds
- **Root cause:** Gemini embedding API hitting 429 "Resource Exhausted" errors
- **Impact:** Memory search falling back to non-batch mode, slowing everything down

### Solution Applied
**Config change:** OpenClaw gateway restarted with:
```json
"memorySearch": {
  "provider": "openai",
  "remote": {"baseUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1", "apiKey": "ollama-local"},
  "fallback": "none"
}
```

**What changed:**
- ✅ Embeddings now use `ollama/nomic-embed-text:latest` (274 MB, 100% local)
- ✅ No more Gemini API calls for memory
- ✅ Eliminated 429 rate limit bottlenecks
- ✅ Gateway restarted successfully (pid 58777)

### New Monitoring Infrastructure
| Component | Location | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Health check script | `~/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/health-check.js` | Analyzes logs for errors/slowdowns |
| Hourly cron job | `openclaw-health-hourly` | Runs every :00 CST, reports to #daily |
| Monitoring docs | `memory/OPENCLAW-MONITORING-SETUP.md` | Full operational guide |

**Installed skills:** log-tail, clawdbot-logs, uptime-monitor

### Result
- Discord response times should normalize (no more 30-313s delays)
- Health checks run automatically every hour
- All embedding processing now local (privacy + performance)

## 📝 TODO Added: Learn X API Search

**User request:** "I thought you could search on twitter. I paid $25 for that api access."

### Action Items
- [ ] Learn X API v2 search endpoints
- [ ] Test reading tweets via direct API calls (using Tweepy)
- [ ] Verify search works with our credentials
- [ ] Document working search patterns
- [ ] Update REMY-SOCIAL-STRATEGY with search workflows

### Test Script Created
- Location: `/Users/thindery/x_search.py`
- Tests: search_recent_tweets, get_user_timeline, get_user_info
- Note: Search requires Bearer Token (Basic tier - $100/mo) OR user says they paid $25 — need to verify tier

### Key Finding
- Free tier: Posting only (1,500 tweets/month)
- Basic tier ($100/mo): 10,000 read/month + search
- Unknown: What does $25 tier include? Need to test

**Next step:** Run x_search.py to test if search works with current credentials
