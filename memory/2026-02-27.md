## Evening Session (9:00 PM - 10:00 PM CST)

### Major Pivot: Agent Paige
**Vision Shift:** From RemyCities (trades) to Agent Paige (AI assistant for everyone who wants a website)

**New Target Customer:**
- Creative dreamers, not tradespeople
- Musicians, writers, photographers, coaches
- Anyone who said "I wish I had a website but it's too hard"

### Domain Research Complete (4 Rounds)
**Available .com Options:**
- **agentpaige.com** 🥇 (LONG-TERM WINNER - not paigebuilds.com)
- **paigebuilds.com** (alternative)
- **paigehelper.com** (backup)

**Research Results:**
- Most .com "build/make" domains taken
- AI-embedded names (mAIke, bAIlder) available in .io
- Paige-based names have strong availability

### Product Positioning Finalized
**Agent Paige = Daily AI Agent Relationship**
- Not a "builder tool"
- An agent you talk to daily
- 3-sentence onboarding
- Clean white aesthetic (Ollama-style)
- Works in ChatGPT/Claude as plugin

### Elon Review Complete
**Elon's Brutal Feedback:**
- You were building a rocket when tradespeople need a bicycle
- Delete 80% of features
- Wrong customer (plumbers don't care)
- Over-engineered

**Response:** User pivoted to Agent Paige vision
- Elon was WRONG about target market (tradespeople)
- RIGHT about simplification
- Built pitch document refuting concerns

### Rate Limiting Implemented (RC-SECURITY-001)
**4-Layer Protection Complete:**
- Global limits: 100 req/min
- Tenant daily: 50-5000 by tier
- Token budgets: 100K-10M/day
- Burst limits: 10-100 req/min per user
- 429 responses with clear messaging
- Redis fallback + webhook alerts

**Status:** Complete, tested, 19/19 tests passing

### Distribution Strategy (NEW)
**ChatGPT/Claude Plugin Strategy:**
- Meet 200M users where they are
- Free tier: Build previews in chat
- Paid tier: $29/month for publish + full access
- 3% conversion = $87K/mo
- 10% conversion = $870K/mo
