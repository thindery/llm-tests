## Risks & Concerns

### Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Platform dependency | High | High | Diversify across multiple marketplaces |
| Skill commoditization | Medium | Medium | Focus on unique/first-mover advantages |
| Technical complexity | Medium | Medium | Start simple, iterate based on feedback |
| Market saturation | Low (for now) | Medium | Move quickly, establish presence |
| Integration maintenance | High | Medium | Choose stable platforms, Version APIs |

### Key Concerns

1. **Timing:** AI agent marketplace space is nascent but growing rapidly - first-mover advantage exists but window may be closing

2. **Quality Standards:** Marketplaces have submission requirements - ensure AgentAds skills meet technical and UX standards

3. **Support Overhead:** Selling skills requires documentation and support - factor this into pricing

4. **Competition:** Large players (Zapier, Salesforce) building native AI capabilities - differentiation is critical

5. **Platform Validation:** Without confirming Moltuni's existence, research may need to pivot - maintain flexibility

## Viability Assessment

### Verdict: VIABLE (but platform TBD)

**Overall Score: 7/10**

**Strengths:**
- Large and growing market for AI agent skills
- Multiple viable marketplace options exist
- Gumroad provides immediate distribution path

**Weaknesses:**
