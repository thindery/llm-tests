## Conversation Summary

user: [Mon 2026-02-02 11:25 CST] so gemini flash works great over the cloud. but are there any other models that i can run locally that wuldn't use tokens?
[message_id: a289b8dd-d34a-4089-9f7b-3670709657ae]
assistant: Yes, absolutely! According to your preferences, the goal is to eventually run local models with **Ollama**, specifically mentioning **qwen2.5:7b-instruct** or similar. This would allow you to process tasks without using tokens and keep everything private on your Mac mini M4.

However, your `MEMORY.md` also notes that Ollama is "not yet working" in your current setup. Is that something you'd like to troubleshoot or set up now?
user: [Mon 2026-02-02 11:25 CST] well i got it working - but it is ssssllloooowwww
[message_id: fe3c5970-eaae-4622-a7c5-db119a97f915]
assistant: Ah, that's a bummer, but good to know you've got it up and running! It's not uncommon for local LLMs, especially larger ones, to be a bit sluggish without dedicated GPUs.

Since you've got the Mac mini M4, we have some good options. We could explore:

1.  **Optimizing your Ollama setup:** Checking for specific Ollama settings or model variations that might run better on Apple Silicon.
2.  **Trying smaller, more efficient models:** There are many models specifically designed to be lightweight and fast, even on CPUs.
3.  **Leveraging Apple's Neural Engine:** Some models can take advantage of the M4's architecture for better performance.

What would you like to dive into first? Or perhaps you have a specific model in mind you'd like to try?
user: [Mon 2026-02-02 11:30 CST] how can i setup grok? I have an API key
[message_id: 86d0ed7a-aaba-4fe9-8c02-cd373f7d52ea]
assistant: Ah, shucks! It looks like my web search tool is missing the Brave Search API key, so I can't directly search for "OpenClaw Grok API integration" right now.

To get that working, you'd need to run `openclaw configure --section web` to set the `BRAVE_API_KEY` or set it in the Gateway environment.

In the meantime, Grok is primarily associated with xAI and Twitter/X. To integrate Grok, we'd typically need:

1.  **An official API client or SDK:** If xAI provides one, that would be the easiest way to interface with it.
2.  **A custom integration:** If there's no direct OpenClaw plugin or SDK, we might need to write some code to interact with Grok's API using standard HTTP requests. This would involve understanding their API documentation.

Since I can't search the web for the specifics, do you happen to have any documentation or links for the Grok API that you could share? That would help me understand how to best approach the integration!
user: [Mon 2026-02-02 11:35 CST] okay i added brave search. how can i get grok working with openclaw?
[message_id: ab717ca2-5b33-468d-817b-d52bd1008076]
assistant: Ah, this is quite illuminating! My web search shows that there's an active feature request on OpenClaw's GitHub (Issue #5775) to add Grok (xAI) support as a *web search provider*. This suggests the community is keen on leveraging Grok's capabilities for information retrieval within OpenClaw.

However, this doesn't sound like it would set Grok up as a conversational model like me. It would integrate Grok into OpenClaw's `web_search` tool.

Since you have an API key, we have a couple of paths:

1.  **Investigate the GitHub Issue:** I can read the full GitHub issue to understand the progress and proposed methods for integrating Grok as a search provider. This might give us clues for a quicker setup, or at least the official direction.
2.  **Custom Skill for Conversational Grok:** If you're looking for Grok to act as a conversational model, we'd likely need to develop a custom skill. This would involve writing Python code to make API calls to Grok using your key and processing its responses.

What do you think, thindery? Should I dig into that GitHub issue first, or would you like to explore creating a custom skill for direct conversational use of Grok?
user: [Mon 2026-02-02 11:36 CST] let's look into the github issue. and then are there any other skills that use grok?
[message_id: 7cfa9e1c-9c9b-4caf-a21c-f49e58779ef5]
assistant: It looks like `web_fetch` struggled to pull the specific content of the GitHub issue, providing a more general GitHub page. My apologies for that, sometimes web scraping can be a bit finicky!

However, based on the initial `web_search` snippet for Issue #5775, the intention is to add **Grok (xAI) as a web search provider** within OpenClaw. This means it would supplement or be an alternative to Brave and Perplexity when using the `web_search` tool, leveraging xAI's `/v1/responses` API. It's focused on enhancing OpenClaw's ability to fetch information, not on making Grok a conversational model that *I* would use directly for dialogue.

Regarding your second question, "are there any other skills that use grok?" — from what I can see in the search results, there isn't an existing OpenClaw skill that directly uses Grok. The GitHub issue is a *feature request*, indicating this functionality isn't built in yet. The mention of "Gork" assistant functionality in one result seems to imply a re-implementation of similar behavior, not a direct Grok API integration.

So, to get Grok working with OpenClaw, you have a couple of main routes:

1.  **Wait for (or contribute to) Issue #5775:** If you're interested in using Grok specifically for web search within OpenClaw, this issue is the official path.
2.  **Develop a custom skill:** If your goal is to have Grok act as a conversational model (like Gemini is now), we would need to create a new skill that interacts with Grok's API directly using your API key.

Which direction would you like to explore first, thindery?
user: [Mon 2026-02-02 11:40 CST] what models would be faster that i can run locally and doesn't use tokens?
[message_id: 19541d67-f637-45c4-b2f1-c5f142fa1e70]
assistant: That's a great question, thindery! Since Ollama is already working (even if slowly), we can focus on finding models that are more optimized for your Mac mini M4 with 16GB RAM.

Based on my web search, here's what I've found regarding faster local LLMs for Apple Silicon with Ollama:

*   **Models in the 7B parameter range** are generally recommended for 16GB RAM. Your initial thought of `qwen2.5:7b-instruct` is a good starting point, but there might be other 7B models that are more efficient.
*   **Quantization matters:** Models with lower quantization (e.g., Q4_0, Q4_K_M) will generally run faster but might have a slight reduction in quality. Higher quantization (e.g., Q8) will be slower but maintain more of the original model's performance. Ollama automatically handles this when you pull models, but you can often specify different quantization levels (e.g., `ollama pull model_name:7b-instruct-q4_K_M`).
*   **Metal Acceleration:** The M-series chips (M1, M2, M3, and your M4) are excellent for local LLMs due to their unified memory architecture and Metal acceleration. Ollama is designed to leverage this, so ensuring your Ollama installation is correctly using Metal is key for performance.

To find *specific* faster models, I'd recommend looking at:

*   **Mistral 7B:** This is a very popular and highly regarded 7B model that often performs well on Apple Silicon.
*   **TinyLlama 1.1B:** If you need something extremely fast for simpler tasks, TinyLlama is much smaller and should be incredibly quick.
*   **Phi-2 (or newer Phi models):** Microsoft's Phi models are known for being quite capable despite their smaller size.

Would you like to try pulling a different 7B model like **Mistral 7B** to see if it performs better than qwen2.5? We could also investigate how to check if Ollama is fully utilizing Metal acceleration on your Mac mini M4.
