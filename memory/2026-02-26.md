# 2026-02-26 - Session Log

## Summary
Thursday was a heads-down infrastructure day — no user sessions, but significant backend improvements shipped. Fixed artifact system, activated research documentation hub, and deployed two new automated cron jobs for business intelligence.

---

## ✅ SHIPPED TODAY

### 1. TASK-053 + TASK-054: Artifact System Fixes (COMPLETE)
- **Problem:** Large artifacts showing "(XKB - too large)" weren't parsing correctly
- **Fixes applied:**
  - File reference parsing now handles "See file: path (size - too large)" format
  - Actual file content loading reads from disk when content is a reference
  - Both endpoints working: `/api/artifacts/[id]/content` (raw markdown) and `/api/artifacts/[id]/render` (HTML)
- **Commits:** `91d74d6`, `645c06a`, `c1110ff`

### 2. Research Documentation Hub Live (COMPLETE)
- **Tool created:** `~/.openclaw/workspace/backlog/research-import.py`
- **12 research docs imported:**
  - DOC-004 through DOC-006: Analytics research (3 docs)
  - DOC-007 through DOC-008: API deployment research (2 docs)
  - DOC-009: AgentAds competitive analysis
  - DOC-010: Moltuni platform research
  - DOC-011: Pay Lobster beta research
  - DOC-012: QMD Memory integration research
  - DOC-013 through DOC-015: X/Twitter API research (3 docs)
- **Browseable at:** http://localhost:3474/artifacts

### 3. Business Researcher Scout Cron (DEPLOYED)
- **Job ID:** `0abd90fa-5a82-4409-94b3-803bdb34527f`
- **Schedule:** 9am, 1pm, 5pm, 9pm CT daily
- **Purpose:** Automated SaaS opportunity scouting
- **Sources:** Reddit (r/SideProject, r/SaaS, r/webdev, r/EntrepreneurRideAlong), Hacker News, Product Hunt, App Store
- **Output:** `~/.openclaw/workspace/memory/BUSINESS-SCOUT-YYYY-MM-DD.md` + Discord report

### 4. Auto-Import Research Docs Cron (DEPLOYED)
- **Job ID:** `e1d349bb-f32d-44a4-b944-0b8ddf017270`
- **Schedule:** 11am, 3pm, 7pm, 11pm CT daily
- **Purpose:** Auto-import new RESEARCH-*.md files to Documentation Hub
- **Behavior:** Silent on success, reports errors or new imports only

### 5. Discord Gateway Issue Resolution (RESOLVED)
- **Time:** ~7:00-7:15 AM CST
- **Issue:** OpenClaw went offline due to WebSocket disconnects
- **Root cause:** Morning briefing TTS + stacked gateway timeouts caused unrecoverable zombie connection state
- **Resolution:** Restarted OpenClaw, system stable since
- **Next:** Monitoring for pattern; may need TTS delivery optimization

### 6. Ralph Status
- Dev backlog: 5 tickets (healthy)
- No action needed throughout day
