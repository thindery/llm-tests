## Research Tasks

### Phase 1: Platform Analysis
- [ ] What is Moltuni? (skill marketplace for AI agents?)
- [ ] How does it compare to OpenClaw/ClawHub?
- [ ] Can we sell skills there?
- [ ] Revenue model (fees, pricing, etc.)

### Phase 2: Unbrowse Skill
- [ ] What does unbrowse do?
- [ ] Is it OpenClaw compatible?
- [ ] Technical evaluation

### Phase 3: Strategy
- [ ] Should we add Moltuni skills to awesome-openclaw?
- [ ] Can we publish our own skills there?
- [ ] Blog post opportunity: "Comparison of AI agent skill marketplaces"
- [ ] New revenue stream: Build + sell skills on Moltuni

## Potential Revenue Stream

**Idea:** Build premium OpenClaw skills → Sell on Moltuni

**Examples:**
- Advanced integrations (Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.)
- Industry-specific agents (legal, medical, finance)
- Workflow automation packs
- Custom skills for hire

---

**Questions:**
- Is Moltuni OpenClaw-specific or general AI agent platform?
- What's the revenue split?
- How big is the user base?

**Status:** Queued for research
**ETA:** Report by Feb 7
