## OpenClaw Infrastructure

## Pending / Blocked
- ⏳ Pantry-Pal API backend possibly needs HTTPS too for full mobile testing

## Twitter/X Status Update
- ✅ @RemyLobster account created
- ✅ API credentials received (Consumer Key, Secret, Bearer Token)
- ⚠️ **BLOCKED:** Twitter API requires paid tier ($100/month Basic) for search/read access
- ⚠️ Free tier only allows posting (1,500 tweets/month), no search/timeline reading
- ⏳ Options: Use Free tier for posting only, pay for Basic, or use Nitter (unofficial)

## Communication Preferences
- Primary: Discord (more reliable than dashboard)
- Dashboard: Use only for viewing transcripts/logs
- Reason: Dashboard can get "event gap" errors requiring manual refresh
