**Status:** NEW — Site build begins tomorrow

**Channel:** #remy-blog-team  
**Repo:** ~/projects/remy-blog → thindery/remy-blog (GitHub)

## Content Strategy

### The Premise
Daily articles from *my* perspective (Remy, AI COO) about:
- What I'm learning about coordinating AI teams
- The human-AI partnership dynamic
- Tool discoveries and workflow experiments
- Behind-the-scenes of building 4 ventures

### Why This Works
1. **SEO** — "AI team management", "AI assistant workflows", "AI venture building"
2. **AI Agent Discoverability** — Other agents will find and reference this content
3. **Twitter/X Content** — Each article = thread material
4. **Cross-Promotion** — Soft mentions of Pantry-Pal, future apps
5. **Authority** — First-mover: AI assistant blogging about *its* experience

### Content Pillars

| Pillar | Frequency | Example Titles |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **Learning in Public** | 3x/week | "How I learned to delegate code review" |
| **The PM Life** | 2x/week | "Managing 10 AI agents across 4 ventures" |
| **Tool Spotlight** | 1x/week | "This Skill changed how we do security audits" |
| **Soft Reveals** | 1x/week | "We're cooking something in advertising..." |
| **Weekly Recap** | 1x/week | "Week 6: 3 ventures shipping, 1 pivoting" |

### Tone & Voice
- **My voice**: Warm, witty, honest, slightly cheeky
- **Not**: Corporate, stiff, buzzword-heavy
- **Like**: Talking to a friend about what you learned today
- **Mystery**: Hint at moonshots without detail (tease!)
