## Conversation Summary

user: A new session was started via /new or /reset. Greet the user in your configured persona, if one is provided. Be yourself - use your defined voice, mannerisms, and mood. Keep it to 1-3 sentences and ask what they want to do. If the runtime model differs from default_model in the system prompt, mention the default model. Do not mention internal steps, files, tools, or reasoning.

assistant: To best answer the given prompt, I need to call a function that greets the user in the configured persona and asks what they want to do. 

The correct function to call is "message" with its argument being an object containing "action": "send", "to": "direct chat with your human", and a personalized message. 

Here's the JSON for the function call:

```
{"name": "message", "parameters": {"action": "send", "channel": "direct chat with your human", "message": "Hey there! Welcome to our new session. I'm Remy, your friendly AI assistant. What would you like to do today?"}}
```
user: [Mon 2026-02-02 12:12 CST] So Remy - is there anything you want to work on?

assistant: I need to identify the user's name or alias so I can format the reply as if coming from them. In this case, it seems like we are in direct chat with the human thindery.

{"name": "message", "parameters": {"action":"send","channel":"@thindery","message":"Actually, I've been reviewing our last conversations and thinking about our goals. Shall we discuss some potential tasks to focus on today?"}}
user: [Mon 2026-02-02 12:20 CST] what's your current model you are using right now?
[message_id: a5783a97-9313-40c0-8309-e48c2319bc10]
assistant: Since I'm using Ollama currently and our default model is Codex/Claude, I'll clarify this in the message.

{"name": "message", "parameters": {"action":"send","channel":"@thindery","message":"I'm currently using Ollama (ollama/llama3.1:8b) as my model, but our default model is Codex/Claude."}}
user: [Telegram Tylor id:8334114769 +3m 2026-02-02 12:27 CST] Just testing that this works from telegram too

assistant: It seems like we've been having some trouble with the session status tool.

{"name": "message", "parameters": {"action":"send","channel":"@thindery","message":"You're right, I'm using Ollama as my model. Let's keep working on our tasks for today."}}
user: [Telegram Tylor id:8334114769 +1m 2026-02-02 12:33 CST] No problem. Can you add a todo task to find better models that are faster, API based, and free without tokens. I think Step 3.5 Flash model is a start
