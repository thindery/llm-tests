### REMY-034: Public Domain Video Sources (COMPLETED)

- Each scene has source attribution (NASA primary, Pexels backup)

### REMY-030: AI Video Research for Sleep Stories (COMPLETED)

- Recommendation: Runway ML Gen-3 (~$4.66 per 3-min video)
- Alternatives: Kling AI 1.6, Pika Labs 2.0, Haiper (free tier)
- 3-minute ancient technology script ready for production

## Tickets Created

### TASK-033: Fix CLI AC Creation to Use API
- Problem: AC created via SQL bypass API, no activity logged
- Solution: Update all AC creation to use `/api/tickets/[id]/ac` endpoint
- Status: To Research

### REMY-032: Research Subagent Timeout Issues
- Investigation needed: Why agents frequently timeout at 5-min limit
- Potential causes: Model speed (Kimi K2.5), task complexity, token usage
- Status: To Research

## Activity Dashboard Stats (Today)
- 12 tickets created
- 2 tickets moved
- 2 tickets completed
- 2 Ralph phases completed
- 26 AC defined (via SQL, needs migration to API)
- 9 comments added

## In Progress
- Moon Journey video production (TTS audio + assembly with public domain footage)
- Output: `moon-journey-film.mp4` → sync folder

## Technical Notes
- Fixed Activity Dashboard build errors (Link import in page.tsx)
- Fixed AC Defined count query (now queries acceptance_criteria table directly)
- Updated dev server to bind to 0.0.0.0 for Tailscale access
