## 5. ONE-MINUTE SAMPLE SPEC

### Sample Video: "The Clockmaker's Library — One Minute Journey"

#### Exact Script (60 Seconds)

```
[00:00-00:15] [Soft whisper, close mic, slow pace]
Welcome to the Clockmaker's Library.
You have found your way here... just as you find your way to sleep.
Each clock in this room... marks a different moment of peace.

[00:15-00:30] [Clock ticking fades in — gentle, rhythmic]
Listen to the grandfather clock by the window.
Its pendulum swings... back... and forth...
Counting down the remaining thoughts of the day.

[00:30-00:45] [Page turn sound, soft paper whisper]
Here, every book holds a year.
Every page... a gentle memory.
You don't need to read them... just knowing they exist is enough.

[00:45-00:60] [Ticking becomes primary, voice fades slightly]
The library is warm.
The rain taps gently against the glass.
And the clocks... they keep perfect time...
for your perfect rest.
Sleep well.
```

curl https://api.moonshot.cn/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KIMI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "kimi-k2.5",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "system", "content": "Write a 60-second sleep story intro. Whisper tone. 4 segments. Include [timing] markers."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "The Clockmaker Library setting. Include clock sounds and rain."}
    ]
  }'
```

**Step 2: Generate TTS via ElevenLabs**
```bash
# Using ElevenLabs API

      "use_speaker_boost": true
    },
    "model_id": "eleven_multilingual_v2"
  }' \
  --output narration.mp3
```

**Step 3: Generate Images via Leonardo**
```bash
# Using Leonardo API
curl -X POST https://cloud.leonardo.ai/api/rest/v1/generations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LEONARDO_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

    "width": 1920,
    "height": 1080,
    "alchemy": true,
    "presetStyle": "CINEMATIC"
  }'
```

**Step 4: Assemble with FFmpeg**
```bash
# Master assembly script: assemble_sample.sh

# 1. Convert images to 15-second clips with Ken Burns
for img in scene*.png; do
  ffmpeg -loop 1 -i "$img" -t 15 -vf "
    zoompan=z='min(zoom+0.08,1.2)':x='iw/2-(iw/zoom/2)':y='ih/2-(ih/zoom/2)':d=360:s=1920x1080:fps=24,
    fade=t=in:st=0:d=0.5,
    fade=t=out:st=14.5:d=0.5
  " -c:v libx264 -r 24 -pix_fmt yuv4200 "${img%.png}.mp4"
done

# 2. Concatenate scenes
ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i scenes.txt -c copy visuals.mp4

# 3. Mix audio layers
ffmpeg -i narration.mp3 -i ticking.mp3 -i rain.mp3 -i pageturn.mp3 -i roomtone.mp3 \
  -filter_complex "
    [0:a]volume=0.8[vo]; 
    [1:a]volume=0.4[ti]; 
    [2:a]volume=0.25[ra]; 
    [3:a]adelay=30000|30000,volume=0.6[pt];
    [4:a]volume=0.15[rt];
    [vo][ti][ra][pt][rt]amix=inputs=5:duration=first[aout]
  " -map "[aout]" -ac 2 -ar 48000 audio_mixed.mp3

# 4. Final mux
ffmpeg -i visuals.mp4 -i audio_mixed.mp3 -c:v copy -c:a aac -b:a 192k -shortest sample_output.mp4
```

**Step 5: Generate Thumbnail**
```bash
# Using ImageMagick
convert scene1.png -gravity center -pointsize 48 -fill white \
  -stroke black -strokewidth 2 -annotate +0+0 "SLEEP STORY\nThe Clockmaker's Library" \
  -resize 1280x720 thumbnail.jpg
```
