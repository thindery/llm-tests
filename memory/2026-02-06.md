# Session Log — 2026-02-06

**Time:** Evening session (~10:00 PM CST)  
**Focus:** Memory system reorganization, engram setup, TODO cleanup

---

## ✅ Major Accomplishments

### 1. OpenClaw-Engram Memory System Activated
- **Installed:** `~/.openclaw/extensions/openclaw-engram/`
- **Mode:** Manual (no OpenAI API key needed)
- **Storage:** `~/.openclaw/workspace/memory/local/`

**Entities Created (6):**
- `person-thindery.md` — User profile with venture links
- `venture-pantry-pal.md` — Launch-ready, domain pending
- `venture-remy-finance.md` — Backend complete, frontend in progress  
- `venture-agentads.md` — POC complete, integration pending
- `venture-sleep-stories.md` — Pipeline ready, sample pending
- `venture-remy-blog.md` — Operational, monetization mapped

**Facts/Corrections Created (9):**
- Discord preference
- Model escalation strategy
- Team workflow structure
- Strict approval requirements
- Ollama cloud correction (my learning!)
- Multi-venture strategy

### 2. TODO System Completely Reorganized

**Scattered todos consolidated into 4-file system:**

| File | Purpose | Items |
|------|---------|-------|
| `REMY-TODO.md` | My research/work | 5 active |
| `REMY-TODO-COMPLETE.md` | My finished tasks | 12+ completed |
| `THINDERY-TODO.md` | Your decisions | 5 active |
| `THINDERY-TODO-COMPLETE.md` | Your actions | 10+ completed |

**New Symlinks:**
- `workspace/REMY-TODO.md` → `memory/REMY-TODO.md`
- `workspace/THINDERY-TODO.md` → `memory/THINDERY-TODO.md`

### 3. New Task: 7AM Voice Briefings
Added to REMY-TODO.md:
- Figure out TTS → voice recording → #briefings channel
- Goal: Daily 7am voice standup (not text)

## 📊 Audit Results

## 🔥 Current Active Blockers

### For thindery:
1. **Pantry-Pal domain** — Buy stockuply.com OR pantrypal.app
2. **OpenClaw 2026.2.6** — Approve update to test cron fix?
3. **Twitter API strategy** — $100/mo vs free vs wait for research

### For Remy:
1. **7am voice briefings** — Research TTS → Discord voice post
2. **True agents investigation** — How did pantry-pal agents work?
3. **Ollama usage monitor** — Maximize $20/mo plan

## 💡 Key Learnings

1. **Engram manual mode works** — Structured storage without API costs
2. **Clear ownership matters** — Separating my tasks from yours reduces confusion
3. **Voice is priority now** — 7am briefings requested in #briefings channel
4. **Ollama is CLOUD** — Corrected my misunderstanding (not local, has caps)
