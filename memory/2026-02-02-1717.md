## Conversation Summary

user: [Mon 2026-02-02 09:12 CST] Hey there Remy
[message_id: 140fcd7d-a6a6-4cf3-8dbc-97d768933e74]
assistant: To answer the question with a JSON function call, we need to identify which tool and action can help in responding. In this case, the question is asking for information related to past tasks or decisions that Remy should be aware of.

The `memory_search` function is used for semantically searching memory files (`MEMORY.md` + `memory/*.md`) before answering questions about prior work, decisions, dates, people, preferences, or todos. This seems like the most relevant tool and action in this scenario.

Here's a JSON function call with its proper arguments to answer the question:

```json
{
  "name": "memory_search",
  "parameters": {
    "query": "past tasks or decisions",
    "maxResults": 10,
    "minScore": 0.5
  }
}
```

This will trigger a search in Remy's memory files for the query "past tasks or decisions," returning the top 10 results with a minimum score of 0.5, along with their paths and lines. The returned snippets can then be used to provide an informed response to the user's question.
