## ADDITIONAL NOTES

### AI Theme Reality Check
**All AI-themed domains are taken.** This indicates:
1. High competition in AI website builder space
2. These domains are being speculatively held
3. Premium prices expected for any AI-related domain

Recommendation: Consider combining AI concept with another theme (text-to-site) rather than AI-only naming.

### Text/Speech Theme Winners
The **text/speech theme** yielded the most available domains:
- saymywebsite.com
- tellmewebsite.com
- wordstosite.com

This theme works well because:
- Describes the input method (voice/text)
- Easy for tradespeople to understand
- Differentiates from traditional drag-and-drop builders

### Comparison to Original Pick
**typemysite.com** (Original #1) is still the benchmark:
- Simpler/stronger than most alternatives found
- "Type" implies text input but doesn't force AI angle
- Shorter than most options researched
- Strong personal ownership with "my"

**Best Alternative:** saymywebsite.com maintains similar strengths while adding voice/speech dimension.
