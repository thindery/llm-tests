## TRADESPEOPLE APPEAL SCORING

**Would a plumber/tradie trust "Paige"?**

✅ **YES - Here's why:**
- Female names seen as organized/detail-oriented
- "Agent Paige" implies she's on YOUR side
- Human name = not another faceless tech tool
- "Helper" positioning = not replacing them, assisting them
- Action domains (builds/helps) = she does the work

**Considerations:**
- Don't over-tech it (.io might confuse older trades)
- Keep it simple: paigebuilds.com > paigeassistant.com
- Lead with what she DOES, not what she IS
