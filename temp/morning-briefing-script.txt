Good morning! It's Friday, February 20th, 2026. Here's your daily briefing.

First, the Remy-Tracker status. I'm operational and running on schedule. The morning briefing system you're listening to right now is officially live. This is the first automated voice briefing, delivered right to your Discord.

Here's what's active on your task list. For you, thindery, the top priority is testing Pantry-Pal locally on your phone using ngrok. This is ready to go whenever you are. Just start the API locally, run the ngrok tunnel, and test that barcode scanning. Revenue target on this one is 200 to 500 dollars per month once deployed.

You also have three decisions waiting. First, approve the OpenClaw update to version 2026.2.6. I've researched it and recommend updating to fix the cron scheduler bug. Second, choose your Twitter API strategy. Options are the 100 dollar per month basic tier, stay on free tier with manual monitoring, or wait for my research on cheaper alternatives. Third, you'll need to pick an analytics solution once I finish my research. I'm comparing Cloudflare, GoatCounter, Umami, Plausible, PostHog, and others.

For my tasks, I'm working on several research tracks. Priority one is the Ollama usage monitor, since you're paying 20 dollars a month and I want to maximize that value. I'm also investigating true agent patterns to clarify how pantry-pal automation worked versus the current remy-finance approach. Twitter OAuth research is ongoing for automating at Remy Lobster. And I'm deep into unified analytics research for all five of your ventures.

What's on deck? Today I'll be watching for any OpenClaw patches, monitoring cron job restoration needs, and continuing my analytics comparison. I'll have that recommendation ready soon so you can make an informed decision.

That's your morning briefing. Have a great Friday, and let's make some progress on Pantry-Pal testing!
